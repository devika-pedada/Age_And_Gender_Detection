# Age_And_Gender_Detection

Introduction:
The Age and Gender Detection Project is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can detect the age and gender of an individual from an image. The project is implemented using Python programming language, Tensorflow and Keras libraries for building the CNN model, and the UTKFace dataset for training and testing.

Working:
The project uses image processing techniques to detect the facial features and extract relevant information about age and gender. The model is trained on a large dataset of facial images, and it learns to recognize the patterns and features that are associated with age and gender. The final model can predict the age and gender of a new image with average accuracy.

Custom CNN Model:
We have created a custom CNN model for the age and gender detection project. The model was trained on the UTKFace dataset, which contains over 20,000 labeled images of faces with age and gender information. The model has been trained and saved with the name of 'AGEmodel.h5'

Exploration using PyTorch:
We are currently exploring the possibility of re-implementing the project using PyTorch library. This will allow us to compare the performance and effectiveness of different deep learning libraries and explore the possibilities of improving the accuracy of the model.
